# Linear-algebra-interpreter
An interpreter for linear algebra expressions

# What does this program do?
This is a simple interpreter for applying, so far, the operators(ie. procedures) "combine", "transpose", "multiply-matrices", and "get-norm" to matrices and vectors where a vector is a List(eg. (list 2 3 4)) and where a Matrix is a list of vectors(eg. (list vector vector ...))

# How to install the software?
Install Dr. Racket from [here](https://download.racket-lang.org/) and then download the code from GitHub. Once DrRacket is installed you can load the file by writing ```(load "name-of-file.rkt")``` and then writing ```(driver-loop)``` to start the REPL. At this point you can start writing expressions. 

If you are using Emacs you need to install ```racket-mode``` via Emacs(ie MELPA) and install Racket with your package manager.
